##Description##
The Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP) is the primary contact for three historic registers (the National Register of Historic Places, the Washington Heritage Register and the Heritage Barn Register) that track Washington's historic and cultural resources.
The National Register of Historic Places is the official federal listing of significant historic, architectural, and archaeological resources. The Washington Heritage Register identifies and documents significant historic and prehistoric resources throughout Washington at the state level. The new Heritage Barn Register was established in May of 2007 and was designed to specifically recognize agricultural resources in the state. 

Each register is reviewed for listing by the Washington State Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), which is comprised of citizens knowledgeable in Washington's history, archaeology, and architecture.  The nine member board reviews nominations to the registers three times a year, at various locations across the state.

In Washington, the National Register is administered by the Department of Archaeology & Historic Preservation (DAHP). Each nomination is reviewed for listing by the WA State Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), which is comprised of citizens knowledgeable in Washington's history, archaeology, and architecture.  The nine member board reviews nominations to the registers four times a year, at various locations across the state.

In addition to the National Register of Historic Places program, DAHP also administers the Washington Heritage Register. The Heritage Register recognizes historically significant properties that for various reasons - usually relocation or incompatible alterations - do not meet the higher standards of National Register designation (all National Register properties also are listed on the Heritage Register).

DAHP staff is available to assist with the initial assessments of eligibility of properties to the registers and to provide guidance in the completion of register nominations.  For more information contact Michael Houser, State Architectural Historian at (360) 586-3076 or email: Michael.Houser@dahp.wa.gov.
