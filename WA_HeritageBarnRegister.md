##Description##
Created with the passage of Substitute HB 2115 in May of 2007, the Washington Heritage Barn Register commemorates barns as historically significant resources representing the agricultural, economic and cultural development of the State of Washington.

“Barns are a symbol of Washington’s agricultural heritage and are beautiful buildings in their own right,” said Governor Chris Gregoire.  “The Heritage Barn register will support the efforts of the Washingtonians who own these barns to preserve and stabilize these icons of our history.”

Jerri Honeyford, Chair of the Barn Advisory Committee, which is overseeing the program, noted that “Barns are such an important building for farmers and ranchers that often they were built before the home.  Ours was, and so was my parent’s.  Designation as a Washington Heritage Barn is a positive step forward in recognizing the role agricultural buildings have played in our history and for acknowledging the stewardship barn owners have provided over several generations.”

In addition to honoring the significance of barns, the new Heritage Barn Register provides the Department of Archaeology & Historic Preservation (DAHP) with more complete information about Washington’s historic agricultural resources.  Despite their prevalence across the state, barns are significantly underrepresented in existing registers and surveys that acknowledge historic resources.  As of 2007, before the Heritage Barn Program started, “Less than 40 barns from Washington were included in the National Register of Historic Places,” noted Michael Houser, the state’s architectural historian responsible for administering the historic register programs for DAHP. “The Heritage Barn Register creates a new level of historic designation that will, we hope, ultimately provide a better understanding of the geographic distribution, style, construction type and history of barns across the state.”

In addition to creating the Heritage Barn Register, the Heritage Barn Preservation Initiative (SHB 2115) provided for:

Competitive matching grants to heritage barn owners throughout the state to support their efforts to preserve, stabilize and rehabilitate their barns; and
Established the Heritage Barn Advisory Committee to review grant applications and examine tax incentives and land use regulations that support barn preservation and use.
To be eligible for listing in the new Heritage Barn Register, barns must be over 50 years old and retain a significant degree of historic and architectural integrity.  Owners interested in seeking designation for their historic barns are asked to complete a nomination form and provide basic information about the property.

The thirteenth round of Heritage Barn nominations are due May 14, 2012. Those barns will be considered for designation at the June 2012 meeting of the Governor's Advisory Council meeting and will be eligible to apply for the grant program (if/when money become available).  Subsequent nominations will be reviewed at proceeding ACHP meetings.

Listing on the Heritage Barn Register is strictly honorary in nature and offers no protection from demolition, nor requires review of alterations and/or changes in use.  Only barns listed on the new Heritage Barn Register, or barns that have been previously listed on the State or National Register will be eligible for grant funding under HB 2115.
